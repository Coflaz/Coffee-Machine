# Coffee Machine Simulator

This Python script simulates a coffee machine with various functionalities such as buying coffee, refilling resources, and turning the machine on/off. It's a console-based program that provides a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Turn On/Off:** Power the coffee machine on or off.

- **Refill Machine:** Refill the machine with water, milk, and coffee beans.

- **Buy Coffee:** Choose from different coffee options (espresso, latte, cappuccino), check availability, and make a purchase. The script also handles the input of coins for payment.

## Usage

1. Run the script in your Python environment.
   ```bash
   python3 coffee_machine.py
   ```

2. Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the coffee machine.

## Delays

To enhance the user experience, the script includes delays between print statements to simulate a more realistic interaction. This ensures that information is presented at a comfortable pace.

- Ensure your terminal or command prompt supports the `cls` (Windows) or `clear` (Unix-based systems) command for better display clarity.
